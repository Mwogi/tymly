__FlobotJS has been developed as an alternative for organisations (especially non-profits and Government departments) who need continually-evolving business software - but can do without the complexity, expense and vendor lock-in that usually accompanies it.__    

By placing an emphasis on openness, collaboration and self-sufficiency, FlobotJS has been specifically engineered to deliver a service that can meet the challenges facing today's Public Sector.

FlobotJS is a [low-code development](http://www.mrc-productivity.com/blog/2016/08/5-huge-benefits-of-low-code-development/) framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
