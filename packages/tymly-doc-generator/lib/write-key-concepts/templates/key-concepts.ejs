## Blueprints

In Tymly, "__blueprints__" provide a way to describe some related components that can coalesce to produce useful software.
Typically a blueprint will describe all the workflows, rules and UI affecting a business function or team - but they're equally suited to describing open-data products and ETL pipelines as well.

![Cartoon illustration of people looking inside a Blueprint](/images/inside-a-blueprint.png#center)

Blueprints equate to a directory containing a simple `blueprint.json` file and one-or-more sub-directories:

| Sub-directory | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
<% blueprintDirs.forEach(function(blueprintDir){ -%>
| `<%=blueprintDir.dirName %>` | <%=blueprintDir.description %> |
<% }); -%>

Running the `yo tymly:blueprint` command will get you building basic blueprints in no time. Please see the [Getting started](/getting-started/) section for help with setting-up Yeoman.

## State machines

All the events that occur inside Tymly are orchestrated by an army of ~~Finite~~ [State Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).
Conceptually, a state machine is nothing more than a collection of [states](https://states-language.net/spec.html#states-fields) that are wired together to describe an executable process.
Each state needs to be assigned a __Type__, some examples:

* __[Task](https://states-language.net/spec.html#task-state)__ states are where all the heavy-lifting is done. Tasks cover all manner of processing: importing data, sending e-mails, form-filling etc.
* __[Choice](https://states-language.net/spec.html#choice-state)__ states are used to implement conditional branching inside a state machine (i.e. configuring states so that they execute only if a certain expression is satisfied).
* __[Parallel](https://states-language.net/spec.html#parallel-state)__ states allow for the concurrent running of two or more states.

If Tymly were to be considered in terms of Model, View, Controller... then State Machines are all about the _Controller_.
Tymly uses the open [Amazon States Specification](https://states-language.net/spec.html) to define state machines inside blueprints, as such, the following constructs are supported:

<img src="/images/sequential-states.png" alt="A diagram showing three states, stringed together sequentially"/>
<img src="/images/choice-states.png" alt="A diagram showing three states, but the final two illustrate two branches"/>
<img src="/images/parallel-states.png" alt="A diagram again with three states, but the first two execute simultaneously">

## Resources

If the purpose of a State Machine is to execute Task states in a controlled manner, then it could be argued Tymly isn't too dissimilar to a microservice architecture.
That said, instead of coordinating remote services over HTTP, Tymly State Machines orchestrate plain-old Javascript object instances.
In Tymly, these objects are conjured from simple classes termed "__Resources__". Each Task State therefore needs to be associated with a single _resource_.

![A state machine containing two form-filling state tasks](/images/double-form-state-machine.png#center)

In the illustration above we have a couple of Task states (one for showing an order-form to a user and a second for showing a survey-form).
Though these states will be configured differently inside the State Machine JSON, they'll both be associated with a common `formFilling` __resource__.

As described below, Tymly is extended through a plugin mechanism which can supply new capabilities. Again, Yeoman is used to help get things started, the `yo tymly:resource` will scaffold a basic resource for you to hack around with.

__Please see the [list of core resources](/reference/#list-of-state-resources) for more detailed information about the type of thing possible out-of-the-box with Tymly.__

## Plugins

![Diagram showing how plugins/blueprints/config/services relate to each other](/images/components.png)

Tymly takes a batteries-included approach and hopefully ships with enough [Resources](/reference/#list-of-state-resources) to conjure most business processes out there.
To help try and keep things minimal and manageable, Resources (and other components) are bundled inside Tymly "__Plugins__". The following are available out-of-the-box:

| Plugin | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
<% pluginList.forEach(function(plugin){ -%>
| [<%=plugin.label %>](<%=plugin.url %>) | <%=plugin.description %> |
<% }); -%>

![Yeoman logo](/images/yeoman.png#floatleft)
Organizations will undoubtedly have specialist requirements of their own - this is where plugins shine, allowing Tymly to be easily extended and adapted as required.

And again, Yeoman can help things along. Running `yo tymly:plugin` will generate a skeleton plugin into which new resources and related components can be added.
